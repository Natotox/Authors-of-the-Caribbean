<b>Mission of Project</b>

I first decided on this project to empower and inspire aspiring caribbean writers/authors. As a child, I was not exposed to many caribbean books, and was not even aware that my country, the Commonwealth of Dominica, had authors. This made the idea of becoming one seem out of reach. I hope that this project may open the eyes of aspiring writers and show them the sheer amount of successful authors in the Caribbean.

While working on this project, I found it fitting to show how much the authors have contributed to caribbean literature. This includes the amount of books they've published, the trends and lessons of their books, and the  common writing styles and ideas that have spread throughout the years.
